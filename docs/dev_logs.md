## 2025-04-15: Migration to google-genai SDK

**Author:** AI Assistant

**Changes:**
- Migrated from `google-generativeai` SDK to the newer `google-genai` SDK (v1.10.0+)
- Updated all API calls and parameter structures to match the new SDK
- Fixed error handling for the new SDK's error hierarchy
- Created documentation in `docs/google_genai_migration.md` detailing the migration process
- Updated the default model from `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` to `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`
- Added support for native async methods in the SDK

**Context:**
Google has deprecated the `google-generativeai` package in favor of the new `google-genai` package. This migration ensures the project uses the latest SDK with better support for newer Gemini models and improved functionality.

**Issues Resolved:**
1. **Package Import Changes** - Updated import statements
2. **API Client Parameter Structure** - Changed how configuration is passed to API calls
3. **Configuration Parameter Naming** - Updated from snake_case to camelCase
4. **Error Handling** - Replaced `BlockedPromptError` with more general error handling
5. **JSON Parsing** - Improved handling of structured output responses
6. **Async Implementation** - Implemented native async support

**Testing:**
- All tests now pass with the new SDK
- Tests ran slower (~45 seconds for one test) due to making real API calls to the Gemini model
- Fixed JSON parsing issues for responses with extra data

**Future Considerations:**
- Consider mocking API calls in tests to improve speed and reliability
- Implement more robust error handling for unexpected response formats
- Document additional API differences as they're discovered
