*   **Refactoring & Multi-Turn Prep:**
    *   Moved `AgentState` and `PPA_REQUIREMENTS` to `src/ppa_agent/state.py` to resolve circular imports.
    *   Attempted to move prompts to `prompts.py` but reverted; defined prompts as constants in `nodes.py` for now.
    *   Fixed various import errors resulting from refactoring.
    *   Added `thread_id` and `email_thread` to `AgentState`.
    *   Added `self.conversation_threads` dictionary to `PPAAgent` for storing thread history and basic state (`customer_info`).
    *   Modified `PPAAgent.process_email` to handle `thread_id`, manage history, and load/save `customer_info` between turns.
*   **Multi-Turn Implementation (Phase 7 Started):**
    *   Updated node prompts (`identify_intention`, `analyze_information`, etc.) to accept and use `email_thread` history.
    *   Added `format_email_thread` helper function in `nodes.py`.
    *   Implemented `process_customer_response` node and `PROCESS_RESPONSE_PROMPT` to analyze replies.
    *   Updated graph routing (`_decide_intent_branch`, `_decide_after_response`) to integrate the new node and handle basic multi-turn transitions.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Created `src/ppa_agent/config.py`.
    *   Moved `PPA_REQUIREMENTS` to `config.py`.
    *   Defined `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME` and `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` in `config.py`.
    *   Updated `agent.py` and `tests/test_integration.py` to use constants from `config.py`.
    *   Switched default Gemini model to `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` to address quota issues.
*   **Testing & Visualization:**
    *   Added `test_multi_turn_info_request_gemini` integration test.
    *   Fixed numerous API errors (503, 429, 404), import errors, syntax errors, and assertion logic in tests.
    *   Updated `visualize_agent.py` to handle the multi-turn test case.
    *   Updated `visualize_agent.py` to generate Mermaid graph definitions instead of SVG and use Mermaid.js CDN for rendering in HTML.

*Initial setup and single-turn workflow implementation...*

## 2025-04-16

*   **Refactoring:** Completed moving core components (nodes, state, config) into dedicated files (`src/ppa_agent/nodes.py`, `src/ppa_agent/state.py`, `src/ppa_agent/config.py`) for better organization.
*   **Multi-turn Implementation (Phase 7 Progress):**
    *   Integrated the `process_customer_response` node into the main graph routing logic.
    *   Refined state management within `PPAAgent` to load/save `customer_info` and append to `email_thread` across multiple calls for a given `thread_id`.
    *   Updated various node prompts to leverage the full `email_thread` context.
*   **Testing:** Added and iterated on the multi-turn integration test (`test_multi_turn_info_request_gemini`), resolving API (Gemini quota/availability), syntax, and assertion errors encountered.
*   **Visualization:** Enhanced `visualize_agent.py` to accurately represent multi-turn sequences in the generated Mermaid diagram and fixed HTML f-string formatting for CSS.
*   **Dependencies & CI:**
    *   Investigated Gemini SDK exception handling (confirmed package installation needed).
    *   Addressed `ruff` line length (`E501`) and complexity (`C901` - pending refactor) warnings.
    *   Resolved `mypy` configuration error by setting `mypy_path = src` in `pyproject.toml`.

## 2024-07-25

*   **Refactoring:** Updated visualization to use Mermaid.js for multi-turn representation.

## 2024-07-26

*   **Refactoring:** Moved Nodes, State, Config classes to separate files (`nodes.py`, `state.py`, `config.py`).
*   **Refactoring:** Moved LLM provider logic to `llm_providers.py`.
*   **Feature:** Implemented basic multi-turn conversation handling:
    *   Added `thread_id` and `email_thread` to AgentState.
    *   Modified `process_email` to handle existing threads and save state.
    *   Added `process_customer_response` node for handling replies.
    *   Updated prompts for context-aware responses.
    *   Updated graph routing logic for multi-turn flow.
    *   Implemented basic state persistence for `customer_info` across turns.
*   **Testing:** Added multi-turn integration test (`test_multi_turn_conversation`).
*   **Fixes:** Address various import errors, API inconsistencies (Gemini), syntax errors, and assertion failures identified during testing.
*   **Chore:** Updated `ruff` configuration in `pyproject.toml` to latest standard.
*   **Chore:** Fixed f-string formatting in `visualize_agent.py` HTML generation.
